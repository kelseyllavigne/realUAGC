/*
    Q3 - What CSS property are you having the most trouble figuring out?
*/
/*
Position. Ultimately I can get it, but I always feel like I'm guessing instead of understanding.
I also don't always understand why when I change the position type, my whole page shifts in (what seems like but obviously isn't because #computers)
unpredictable ways. Like I said, I ultimately find the right answer, and I do often understand, but there are plenty of times where I don't understand,
or wish I had understood sooner so that I don't need to readjust all of my CSS.
*/

/*
    Q4 - What is the best CSS property and why?
*/
/*
Flexbox. Times a million. Doing all of this aligning work is work. But when you can use flexbox, it gets so easy. Not just easier, but outright
easy most of the time. It cuts down on time and headaches when trying to create grids and grid-like structures. It is also a great entry-way into coding.
It's one of those things that when you apply display: flex, you feel like a magician. It's important to have those moments as you are learning so that
your experience isn't comprised too heavily of feeling like a little bit of a failure as you stumble through the learning process.
